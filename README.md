# React Arrays Exercise - Solution Proposal

- Handling of arrays & objects in complex structures
  - Array of objects with nested objects as properties
- Array methods
  - `.map`, `.toSorted` & `.filter`
- Complex ternary operators
- React components & props
- Functions: applyFilters accepts a users array as parameter and returns a filtered/sorted array
- React State: As little as possible! Try to derive as much as possible from existing state!
- React state variables should be "The single source of truth"
- Conditional rendering: Set classes/styles depending on the value of a state variable. (e.g. button `active`class)
